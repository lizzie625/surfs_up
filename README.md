# Surfs Up  
## Overview  
Our client, W. Avy, wants us to further our analysis before he finishes deciding whether or not to open up a surf/ice cream shop. We are going to give him the temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, Hawaii to help him in determining if his business idea would be manageable year round.  
## Results  
### June  
We ran the summary statistics for June where it shows:  
* the average temperature is about 75 degrees (F) in June. 
* the analysis was taken from 1700 entries
* The minimum temperature was 64 degrees

The summary statistics for December show:

## Summary  
From the current results we have, it seems like a surf/ice cream shop would be able to run year round due to the average temperature only decreasing 4 degrees from June to Decemeber. However, other factors should be factored in to guarentee that business will be consistent year round. Whether and tourism could both have large effects on this business. With surfing being an outdoor sport and ocean conditions being largely unpredictable, we should run additional queries where we can. We decided to run the data for precipitation in both months. Our results show that, while there does seem to be increased precipitation in December, precipitation is manageable in both months and should not impact business too much. To take it a step further we could run precipitation reports for September and March.  ![precip](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96501958/156964142-d59e3262-6ab8-459c-a7ca-5464c9e0349b.png)
